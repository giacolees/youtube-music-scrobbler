## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- A [Last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/)
- [Last.fm API Credentials](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

### 2. Setup YouTube Music Authentication
To fetch your history, you need to provide your YouTube Music session headers.

1.  **Generate `browser.json`**:
    Follow the [ytmusicapi setup instructions](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/browser.html).
    Essentially:
    - Open YouTube Music in Chrome.
    - Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Network Tab.
    - Filter for `/browse`.
    - Right-click the request -> Copy -> Copy as cURL (bash).
    - Run `ytmusicapi browser` and paste the command when prompted.
2.  **Encrypt your credentials**:
    ```bash
    python encrypt_auth.py
    ```
    This will create `browser.json.enc` and output an **Encryption Key**.
    - **SAVE THIS KEY!** You will need it for your `.env` or GitHub Secrets.
    - Delete the original `browser.json` file.

### 3. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-music-scrobbler.git
cd youtube-music-scrobbler
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configuration
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```ini
LAST_FM_API=your_api_key
LAST_FM_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
YTMUSIC_AUTH_KEY=your_encryption_key
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url (optional)
```

### 5. First Run
```bash
python start_ytm_scobble.py
```
On the first run, it will open your browser to authorize Last.fm. Once done, a `LASTFM_SESSION` will be saved to your `.env` file.

## 🤖 Automation (Recommended: cron-job.org)

The recommended way to automate scrobbling is using [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) to trigger GitHub Actions workflows externally. This approach is more reliable than GitHub Actions' built-in scheduler, which can experience delays on the free tier.

### Why cron-job.org?
- **More reliable execution timing** - No delays from shared runner load
- **External scheduling** - Independent of GitHub's scheduler
- **Easy testing** - Use the "Run now" button for immediate testing
- **No workflow changes needed** - Works with the existing GitHub Actions setup

### Quick Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token** (Fine-grained recommended)
   - Required permissions:
     - Actions → Read and Write
     - Contents → Read

2. **Create a cronjob on cron-job.org** with these settings:

   **URL:**
   ```
   https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/youtube-music-scrobbler/actions/workflows/sync.yml/dispatches
   ```

   **Method:** `POST`

   **Headers:**
   ```
   Content-Type: application/json
   Accept: application/vnd.github+json
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT
   ```

   **Request Body:**
   ```json
   {
     "ref": "master"
   }
   ```

   **Schedule (Daily at 10:00 PM IST):**
   ```
   30 16 * * *
   ```
   (GitHub API expects UTC time)

3. **Add secrets to your repository** (if not already configured):
   - `LAST_FM_API`, `LAST_FM_API_SECRET`, `LASTFM_SESSION`
   - `YTMUSIC_AUTH_KEY`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`

4. **Test the setup** using the **Run now** option in cron-job.org

5. **Monitor executions** at:
   ```
   https://github.com/<username>/youtube-music-scrobbler/actions
   ```

### Security Note
Never commit or expose your GitHub Personal Access Token publicly.  
If a token is accidentally exposed, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.

## Alternative: GitHub Actions Built-in Scheduler

GitHub Actions also has a built-in scheduler, but it's less reliable on the free tier. If you prefer to use it instead of cron-job.org:

1.  Follow the [**GitHub Actions Guide**](GITHUB_ACTIONS_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.
2.  Uncomment the `schedule` section in `.github/workflows/sync.yml`:
    ```yaml
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '37 16 * * *' # 10:07 PM IST
    ```
3.  Add your secrets to the repository (same as above).
4.  Commit `browser.json.enc` (but **NEVER** `browser.json`).

**Note:** The built-in scheduler is commented out by default in favor of cron-job.org for better reliability.
